PyTorch model built for custom image data. The modell is trained om a compressed version of the Food101, only including 3 categories (pizza, steak, sushi). Built as of now with trivail data augmentation, however, will increase image size handled by the model [(64,64)->(224,224)]. The model is a convolutional neural network based on the Tiny VGG architecture, however, will customize architecture to better fit data in the future. Results are as of now both underfitting and overfitting, however, will update when changes are implemented. Preferably run this script on a GPU as training is somewhat computationally demaning.
